Something other than an associated function has been used when one was
expected.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0801
#![feature(return_type_notation)]

const FOO: i32 = 0;

fn test()
where
    FOO(..): Send,
{
}
```

In the given example, within the where clause `FOO(..): Send`, `FOO` resolves
to a const when only trait methods are supported with return-type notation.
