An associated function of the given name is not in scope.

Erroneous code examples:

```compile_fail,E0802
#![feature(return_type_notation)]

trait Trait {}

fn test<T: Trait>()
where
    <T as Trait>::method(..): Send,
{
}
```

To fix this error, please verify you didn't misspell the associate function
name, or double-check if you forgot to declare the parameter in the list of
generics.
